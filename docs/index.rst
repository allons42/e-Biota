Documentation for eBiota
======================

Welcome to the online documentation for eBiota.

eBiota is a platform for the automated *ab initio* design microbial communities with desired functions from a large-scale bacterial seed pool and predict their behaviors. It combines three novel algorithms: CoreBFS, ProdFBA, and DeepCooc, significantly reducing cost and time required for designing microbial communities, with these savings increasing exponentially as the microbial community grows. For more information, see our paper: **eBiota: ab initio design microbial communities from large-scale seed pools using deep learning and rapid optimization with microbial community-scale metabolic models**.

eBiota is built and maintained by the `ZhuLab`_ at Peking University. All codes are available at `Github`_.
