Documentation for eBiota
======================

Welcome to the online documentation for eBiota.

eBiota is a platform for the automated *ab initio* design of artificial microbial communities with desired functions from a large seeding pool. It combines novel screening algorithms, modified FBA and deep learning co-occurrence prediction algorithms for community design. For more information, see our paper: **eBiota: ab initio design microbial communities from large-scale seed pools using deep learning and optimization algorithm with microbial community-scale metabolic models**.

eBiota is built and maintained by the `ZhuLab`__ at Peking University.
